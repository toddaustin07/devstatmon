# devstatmon
Device ONLINE/OFFLINE status monitor

## Pre-requisites
* [edgebridge](https://github.com/toddaustin07/edgebridge)
* LAN Presence Edge driver from my [shared projects channel](https://bestow-regional.api.smartthings.com/invite/d429RZv8m9lo)
* Python 3.x

## Instructions

1. Download devstatmon.py and devstatmon.cfg to a directory on your computer
2) Edit devstatmon.cfg:
    * The first 3 entries represent each of the devices you want to monitor and is a list of one or more values separated by commas.  Each of the three entries should contain the same number of comma-separated items
      * device_names - list of short alphanumeric names representing the devices (no blanks or special characters)
      * device_ids - list of corresponding SmartThings device IDs in UUID format (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) hexidecimal characters
      * polling_interval - list of desired corresponding polling intervals in seconds
    * SmartThings_Bearer_Token - your [personal token](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens); be sure that it includes authorization for reading location and devices
    * port - port number to be used by this application (defaults to 50003)
    * bridge_address - IP:port number of the edgebridge server application
    * console_output - yes/no
    * logfile_output - yes/no
    * logfile - name of log file (defaults to devstatmon.log); will be in the current working directory
    
    Example:
 ```
 [config]
device_names = dev1, dev2, dev3
device_ids = 72fa839a-2a8d-40ad-b21d-e25722f4d3e5, 82d03cd4-7bc6-49fd-bf40-0a4319fb1799, ff235174-56df-4a0f-a8a1-5821cbdb3e05
polling_interval = 600, 600, 600
#
SmartThings_Bearer_Token = 1234abcd-56ef-78ab-9cde-abcd1234ef56
#
port = 50003
bridge_address = 192.168.1.140:8088
#
console_output = yes
logfile_output = yes
logfile = devstatmon.log
```
3. Be sure edgebridge is installed and running
4. If needed, install the LAN Presence Edge driver to your hub from [this channel](https://bestow-regional.api.smartthings.com/invite/d429RZv8m9lo)
  * Create a separate LAN Presence device for each SmartThings device you configured above
  * For each LAN Presence device, configure device Settings:
    * LAN Device Name - the short name you used in the devstatmon.cfg file
    * LAN Device Address - the IP:port address where your devstatmon app will be running (e.g. 192.168.1.30:50003)
    * Bridge Address - the IP:port address where your edgebridge app is running (e.g. 192.168.1.140:8088)
  * Monitor the edgebridge console output, you should see a registration message received from the driver for each device configured
5. Start the devstatmon app:
```
python3 devstatmon.py
```

Watch the console output of the devstatmon app.  You should begin to see messages like this:

The SmartThings API is polled based on the interval you configured.  Updates are sent to your SmartThings presence device when there is a change or every 30 minutes whether or not there is a change.  **ONLINE = present, OFFLINE = not present**
